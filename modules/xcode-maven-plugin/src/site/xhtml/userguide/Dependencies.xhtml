	<h3>Dependencies</h3>
	<p>
		Most every project depends upon others to build and run correctly. The
		Maven downloads and links the dependencies for you on compilation and
		other goals that require them. Additionally, Maven brings in the
		dependencies of those dependencies (transitive dependencies), allowing
		your list to focus solely on the dependencies your project requires.
		More information on <a
			href="http://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Dependencies">Dependencies</a>
		section from the official Maven Documentation.
