	<h2>
		The Project POM<br />
	</h2>

	<p>
		The POM (Project Object Model) is the fundamental unit of work in
		Maven. It is an XML file that contains information about the project
		and configuration details used by Maven to build the project. For more
		information, visit the <a
			href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html">Introduction
			to the POM</a> on the official Maven Documentation.
	</p>

	<p>To prepare your project to be built within the MiOS, do this two
		steps:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Create a pom.xml file, placed into your project-root folder as shown below.</li>
		<li>Adjust the <b>groupId</b> and the <b>artifactId</b>
			in the pom.xml as suitable for your project. The
			artifactId must be the same as your XCode project name.
		</li>
		<li>If your project has dependencies to other projects, they
			should be added to the <tt>dependencies</tt> section. More
			information on <a href="Dependencies.html"
			title="Dependency management">Dependency management</a>.
		</li>
	</ul>
