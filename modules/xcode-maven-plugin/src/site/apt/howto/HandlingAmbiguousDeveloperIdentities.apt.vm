How to handle ambiguous developer identities

* Purpose of this page
 
   This page described how developers can deal with ambiguous developer identities when working in the local development environment.
   In case a developer is member of several projects she might have several developer identities located in the keychain.
   Typically all identities starts with "iPhone Developer" and this name is also used inside the xcode project configuration. When
   codesigning is performed as part of the xcodebuild the build fails since the codesign identity is ambiguous.
   
* How to deal with several developer identities
 
   First of all it needs to be checked if there is a strong reason for having more than one identity.
   
   In case several developer identities are needed and exists inside the keychain all starting with "iPhone Developer" the full qualified name needs
   to be provided. The full qualified name is displayed inside the keychain and looks typically "<<<iPhone Developer: <FirstName> <LastName> (<hash>)>>>".
   The hash is different for each certificate and ensures that the certificates are unique.
   The full qualified name can be handed over to xcodebuild, e.g.: <<<xcodebuild clean build -configuration Release -sdk iphoneos CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="iPhone Developer: Jane Doe (V48YT59D7Z)">>>.
   When using the xcode-maven-plugin the codesign identity can be provided on command line with <<<-Dxcode.codeSignIdentity>>>, e.g. <<<mvn clean install -Dxcode.codeSignIdentity="iPhone Developer: Jane Doe (V48YT59D7Z)" >>>
   
   Do not denote your full qualified identity inside the xcode project itself. This causes the build to fail for other developers.
